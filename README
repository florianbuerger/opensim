    Opensim is a shell script that makes accessing applications on the iPhone
simulator a breeze.

Examples.

opensim SomeApp Preferences
    Opens the Preferences folder for SomeApp.
    ( ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/User/Applications/<GUID>/SomeApp.app/Preferences )

opensim SomeApp Documents
    Opens the Documents folder for SomeApp
    ( ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/User/Applications/<GUID>/SomeApp.app/Documents )

opensim SomeApp sqlite3 some_sqlite_database.sqlite
    Opens runs sqlite3 with the full path to some_sqlite_database.sqlite as its
    first argument.
    ( sqlite3 ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/User/Applications/<GUID>/SomeApp.app/Documents/some_sqlite_database.sqlite )

    Note:
        If you have more than one file with the same name in two different
        directories, ie db.sqlite in Documents/ and db.sqlite in SomeApp.app/
        you would need to specify it by doing something like:
        opensim SomeApp sqlite3 app/db.sqlite
            This would open SomeApp.app/db.sqlite
        opensim SomeApp sqlite3 Documents/db.sqlite
            This would open SomeApp.app/Documents/db.sqlite

opensim updateLinks ~/iPhoneSimulatorApps
    Creats symlinks for all installed apps in ~/iPhoneSimulatorApps
    Note: <link_dir> must already exist.
